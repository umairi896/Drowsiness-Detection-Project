# Drowsiness-Detection-Project

This project aims to detect drowsiness in individuals, particularly drivers, using computer vision techniques. The system monitors the driver's facial expressions and alerts them when signs of drowsiness are detected, helping to prevent accidents due to driver fatigue.

## Features:
Detects drowsiness by analyzing facial expressions in real-time.
Utilizes OpenCV for image processing and face detection.
Implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for eye state classification.
Alerts the user with audio or visual cues when drowsiness is detected.
Cross-platform compatibility: Works on various operating systems due to library compatibility.

## Technologies Used:
OpenCV (cv2): Used for real-time image processing, facial detection, and feature extraction.
TensorFlow & Keras: Employed to build and train a deep learning model for eye state classification.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations and array manipulation.
OS: Used for operating system-related tasks such as file handling.
Tkinter: Used to develop a simple graphical user interface for the project.

## Usage:
Launch the application by running main.py.
Position your face within the camera frame.
The system will start monitoring your eye movements.
If drowsiness is detected, you will receive an alert.

## Contribution:
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve this project or add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
